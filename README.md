# VirtualBookingCom
See your vacation today!

## What?
With this application, you can make decisions about your next vacation and see the impact right away.

You'll get an audio-guided tour of your vacation where you can decide:
* where you want to go (city and Hotel)
* how much you want to eat @ the Hotel
* how you want to fly

For every decision you make you can see and hear all avaiable options. If you decide which one you want it will get added to your tab.

## Why?
This project seeks to help those who've never been on vacation (or a Plane, for that matter) and don't want to have any bad surprises during their stay. It was created during the Booking.com Hackathon 2017.

## How?
This app was built in unity with the VRTK and the SteamVR Toolkit. It's basically just a Number of photospheres after another. The logic is written in C#.
